## Netflix Clone.. Like...

Welcome to the **"Notflix"** Clone Project, where we pretend to be Netflix but with a lot more **AWS** wizardry and a sprinkle of humor!

Our mission? To create a **Notflix** clone using a whole arsenal of **AWS** goodies like ECR, ECS, S3, and CloudFront. Weâ€™re also throwing in **Docke** and **Terraform** because why not? The backend is powered by **Flask** and the **TMDB API**, while the frontend is all about that **React** magic.

But wait, there's more! We've set up a super slick **CI/CD** pipeline using **GitHub Actions** to make sure our deployment process is smoother than a freshly buttered popcorn. So sit back, relax, and get ready to binge-watch our progress (and hopefully not our mistakes) as we bring this clone to life!

or

The project aims to develop a Netflix clone using various AWS resources (AWS Parameter Store, ECR, ECS, and S3), Docker, Terraform, API Gateway . The application includes both backend and frontend components. The backend is built with Flask and the TMDB API, while the frontend is built with React. The project involves setting up a CI/CD pipeline to automate the deployment process.


## Our role play... Dont judge us... Though we dont live up to it...

## What do we use...
1. **GitHub**: The source code repository where the code for the application resides.
2. **GitHub Actions**: The CI/CD pipeline tool used to automate the build, test, and deployment processes.
3. **AWS VPC**: The virtual network within AWS that hosts all the AWS resources.
4. **Internet Gateway (IGW)**: Enables internet access for resources within the VPC.
5. **Public Route Table (RT)**: Manages the routing for the public subnets within the VPC.
6. **Public Subnets**: Subnets with direct access to the internet.
7. **Private Route Table (PrivateRT)**: Manages the routing for the private subnets within the VPC.
8. **Private Subnets**: Subnets without direct internet access, using a NAT gateway for outbound connections.
9. **NAT Gateway**: Provides internet access for resources in the private subnets.
10. **Application Load Balancer (ALB)**: Distributes incoming application traffic across multiple targets (ECS tasks). Uses SSL certificates from ACM.
11. **Target Group (TG)**: A group of ECS tasks registered with the ALB to receive traffic.
12. **Route 53**: DNS service to route traffic to the ALB and CloudFront distribution.
13. **ECR**: Amazon Elastic Container Registry to store Docker images.
14. **ECS Cluster**: Amazon Elastic Container Service cluster to manage Docker containers.
15. **ECS Service**: Manages the running of ECS tasks.
16. **ECS Task**: The Docker container running the Flask API.
17. **CloudWatch Logs**: Monitors and logs the ECS task activities.
18. **S3 Bucket**: Stores the static files for the React frontend application.
19. **CloudFront Distribution**: Caches and serves the frontend application content from S3.
20. **Flask API**: The backend application built with Flask.
21. **TMDB API**: External API used by the backend to fetch movie data.
22. **YouTube API**: External API used by the backend to fetch YouTube data.
23. **React App**: The frontend application built with React.
24. **Terraform**: Infrastructure as Code tool used to provision and manage AWS resources.
25. **ACM**: AWS Certificate Manager used to manage SSL/TLS certificates for securing traffic.
26. **End User Device**: The device used by the end user to access the application.
