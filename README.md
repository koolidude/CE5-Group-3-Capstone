## Netflix Clone.. Like...

Welcome to the **"Notflix"** Clone Project, where we pretend to be Netflix but with a lot more **AWS** wizardry and a sprinkle of humor!

Our mission? To create a **Notflix** clone using a whole arsenal of **AWS** goodies like ECR, ECS, S3, and CloudFront. Weâ€™re also throwing in **Docke** and **Terraform** because why not? The backend is powered by **Flask** and the **TMDB API**, while the frontend is all about that **React** magic.

But wait, there's more! We've set up a super slick **CI/CD** pipeline using **GitHub Actions** to make sure our deployment process is smoother than a freshly buttered popcorn. So sit back, relax, and get ready to binge-watch our progress (and hopefully not our mistakes) as we bring this clone to life!

or

The project aims to develop a Netflix clone using various AWS resources (AWS Parameter Store, ECR, ECS, and S3), Docker, Terraform, API Gateway . The application includes both backend and frontend components. The backend is built with Flask and the TMDB API, while the frontend is built with React. The project involves setting up a CI/CD pipeline to automate the deployment process.
